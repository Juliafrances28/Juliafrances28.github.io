# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

I created a responsive portfolio using bootstrap

## Steps

I started off with the following files

- `index.html`

- `portfolio.html`

- `contact.html`

# naviagtion bar

- starting with index.html file I worked on the nav. bar

- makiing sure it was layout properly using the bootstrap using the bootstrap nav bar code.

- picking the nav bar code on bootstrap that incorporated <ul> <li> code so allow the links/page titles line up next to each other at one end of the nav bar

- Creating a brand icon on the right side

- making sure it was the same on all three pages

- confirming that the links work

# grid layout index. html

- Usign bootstrap I choose the code with the proper grid layout

- Including containers, rows and col

- I was able to add the proper spacing so that each my two rows had <div class="col-sm-4"> <div class="col-sm-8"> had two colums the smaller image col at 4 and the double sized paragraph col at 8
  so the spacing for the row adds up to 12.

- This code also had <div> and classes.

- It allowed me to add css styling inline style within the various tags

- I was able to input my <p> content and <img> with proper links

# grid layout contact.html

- I used the cardlayout creating a container

- including a header section for my name and a section for the require text

- I finshed the contact page with a <img> of girl coding
