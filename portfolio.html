          My role in this project was to create the moreinfo page. The front-end team used Material UI as our framework. This
          page allows people to get more information on covid-19 testing
          including the value of getting tested and frequently asked
          questions. I included many design elements including, a header, an
          image tag, and the layout and used css to style my page. my work:

          My role in this project was to design the form for the registration page. The front-end team used material UI as our framework
          library. I also added multiple design elements which improve the
          viewer appeal of the page. This includes, the header, the navbar
          with the cute dancing book animation and the image of the books. I
          created the proper layout and added buttons. I coordinated the
          colors and styled everything to make it fun and eye catching to
          ultimately encourage someone to join.

          As a team, we created an app called theresFoodatHome.
          theresFoodatHomeis an online app created for users to avoid food waste and
          encourage them to eat at home. The goal was to work towards
          eliminating food waste. theresFoodAtHome helps the users keep
          track of the expiration date on the food they purchased. It also
          offers suggsted recipes to use up foods that will expire soon.
          Deployed site:

          My role in this project was to do the styling for the Sign Up and
          Sign In pages. I worked. I focused primarily on styling aspects
          for both pages using css to generate a cleaner appearance to the
          page. This includes adding images and a title to the header
          section, including a navbar with links, additionally adding
          buttons and a footer.
